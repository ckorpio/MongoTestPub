# MongoTestPub
Code for testing Mongo DB. The testmongo.js is similar to MongoRender repository, but this one contains testadd.js with additional Mongo DB access examples. 
It can be used to deploy a working app which can also access a Mongo DB.
<p>
The testadd.js contains an example of links to endpoints. The default route utputs html for 2 links leading to 2 different endpoints of the same program.
</p>
It also contains multiple examples of endpoints <i><b>writing</b></i> to a Mongo database.. One the examples illustrate how to use user input provided as parameter(s) on a route to generate objects to write in the database.
<p>
The repository MongoTest is the same but it is a working example.
